# Rope-Data-Structure

Here are some tests and examples of how to use the basic rope functions.
The rope class and rope header are SGI extensions; they are not part of the C++ standard library.

I show how to index a rope with the .at() function.

I used .insert() to show how to easily add characters to a rope.

Finally I showed how to delete words from the rope with the .erase() function.
